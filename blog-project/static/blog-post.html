            <p>
              Climbing Mount Kilimanjaro was one of the reasons I wanted to
              travel to Africa in the first place. But before I climbed Kili the
              first time, I knew very little about it and had never climbed a
              big mountain before, so the thought of it was completely
              overwhelming. Kilimanjaro isn’t the highest mountain, but it is
              difficult and the success rates are relatively low. This is
              usually down to lack of preparation and the effects of altitude
              sickness. However, there are a lot of things you can do to ensure
              you have a successful climb! So, based on my experiences, here’s
              everything you need to know to start preparing for your own
              Kilimanjaro trek. If there’s anything that I haven’t covered,
              leave your questions in the comments below and I’ll answer them or
              point you in the right direction! Reaching the top was one of the
              most incredible moments of my life (twice) and with my preparation
              tips, I hope it will be one of yours too!

            <h4>Train for Your Trek</h4>
            <blockquote
              cite="https://www.heleninwonderlust.co.uk/tips-for-climbing-kilimanjaro/"
            >
              Some people are natural hikers and some people aren’t. To maximise
              your chances of reaching the top, make sure you do a bit of
              training before you go. Even if it’s just walking around your home
              town with your bag (and make sure you weight it and remember you
              will be carrying at least 3 litres of water, plus snacks,
              clothing, camera etc. in your bag each day).
            </blockquote>
            <h4>Visit Your Doctor</h4>
            <p>
              Before you take on a strenuous trek like Kili, it is always a good
              idea to visit your doctor for a check-up. Whilst you âre there you
              will also be able to ask about malaria tablets and Diamox (the
              drug that helps combat altitude sickness).
            </p>
            <h4>Wear in Your Boots</h4>
            <p>
              Building on from the first point, one of the most important things
              you can do to prepare for Kili is to wear in your hiking boots.
              Blisters are the bane of your life on Kilimanjaro, so try to avoid
              them at all costs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even if you have had them for a while, it's quite different
              wearing boots for a couple of hours on a hike to wearing them
              almost constantly for a week. You can do this by going for
              practice treks and wearing your boots as often as you can, even if
              it's just around the house or to go to the shops to stretch the
              boots and toughen up your pressure points.
            </p>
            <h4>Choose Your Trek & Trekking Company Carefully</h4>
            <p>
              You cannot climb Kilimanjaro without a licensed guide, so you will
              need to book your trek through a registered company. Along with
              guides, you will also have porters and a chef. Historically, some
              of the workers on Kilimanjaro (porters especially) weren't (and
              some still aren't) always paid very well and had (and still have)
              to work under terrible conditions, especially considering the
              backbreaking (and potentially dangerous) work they do.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without the porters, most people would not be able to climb
              Kilimanjaro. They carry all your equipment, food and clothing up
              the mountain, so all you have to carry is your daypack. As a
              result, KPAP was founded. KPAP, stands for the Kilimanjaro Porters
              Assistance Project, a not-for-profit organisation who regulate
              standards for workers on Kilimanjaro.
            </p>
            <h4>Choose Your Route Carefully</h4>
            <p>
              Whilst climbing Kili in the fastest time possible might seem like
              a good idea, taking longer to climb will help your chances of
              success.<br />
              There are seven established routes to climb Mount Kilimanjaro –
              <u
                >Marangu, Machame, Lemosho, Shira, Rongai, Northern Circuit and
                Umbwe.</u
              >
              There is another called the Western Breach – but it’s notoriously
              more dangerous than the other routes, and many tour operators
              don’t use it.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Marangu: </strong> Known as the <q>Coca-Cola</q> route,
              the Marangu route is known as the easiest due to the gradual
              slope. However, it has one of the lowest success rates, probably
              because people choose do it over 5 days. This is the only route
              with huts you can stay in.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Machame:</strong> This is known as the
              <q>Whiskey</q> route, difficult and busy, but one of the most
              scenic routes! This is the route I took the first time! You can
              read about my trip<a class="link" href="#"> here.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Lemosho:</strong> Similar to the Machame Route, using some
              of the same paths, so also very scenic but with less traffic. Can
              also do this over 8 or 9 days which helps for acclimatization.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Rongai: </strong> An easier route than Machame, Lemosho,
              and Shira, but less crowded than the Machame Route.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Northern Circuit: </strong>This is the newest Kili route
              and the longest so it now has one of the highest success rates.
              It’s great for the scenery too. Furthest drive from Moshi.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Umbwe: </strong> A very direct route that is known to be
              extremely challenging. This is not for the faint-hearted and
              should only be attempted by climbers who are confident that their
              body responds well to altitude.
            </p>
            When I take my groups up, we do the Lemosho Route over 8 days (6
            days up, 2 down). This has a very high success rate. The first time
            I climbed Kili, I did the Machame Route. I was meant to climb over 7
            days but did it in 6 (5 up, 1 down).
            <h4>Join a Group</h4>
            <p>
              If you don't want to trek alone, then find a group to join. For
              me, trekking in a group was so much better than doing it alone.
              But that's just me, you might want to trek by yourself. There are
              plenty of group treks available, so reach out to various operators
              and ask when they have open treks you can join.
